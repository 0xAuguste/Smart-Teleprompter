String text = "Hey kids, shake it loose together. The spotlights hitting something that's been known to change the weather. We'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around. Youre gonna hear electric music. Solid walls of sound. Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?. Ooh, but theyre so spaced out, B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets. Oh but theyre weird and theyre wonderful. Oh Bennie shes really keen. Shes got electric boots, a mohair suit. You know I read it in a magazine, ohh-oh. B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets. Hey kids, plug into the faithless. Maybe theyre blinded. But Bennie makes them ageless. We shall survive, let us take ourselves along. Where we fight our parents out in the streets. To find whos right and whos wrong. Oh Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?. Oh but theyre so spaced out, B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets. Oh theyre so weird and theyre wonderful. Oh Bennie shes really keen. Shes got electric boots, a mohair suit. You know I read it in a magazine, ohh-oh. B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets. Oh Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?. Oh but theyre so spaced out, B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets. Oh but theyre weird and theyre wonderful. Oh Bennie shes really keen. Shes got electric boots, a mohair suit. You know I read it in a magazine, ohh-oh. B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets. Bennie, Bennie and the Jets. Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets. Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets. Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets. Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets. Jets, Jets. Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie. Bennie, Bennie and the Jets";
